## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to analyze New York Tree Census Data Set, health distribution of the trees in New York and Top tree species in NY.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nycparks/tree-census

## Project Motivation
This project is part of Data Engineering Zoomcamp by [Alexey Grigorev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJZDmreIpA&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb).The data-set 
"Tree Census in New York City" is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 
The direction I took was to investigate the data, 
find insights, trends and information.
